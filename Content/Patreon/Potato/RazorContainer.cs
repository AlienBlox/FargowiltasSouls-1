     * Name: Razor Container
Sprite should be a small wooden box containing sawblades or something similar.
It's a pre-boss accessory that should help out melee a bit.

Crafting: 10 Wood, 15 Iron/Lead, 6 Chains @ Anvil
Effect: Spawns 2 spinning sawblades in front of the player that are slightly bigger than half the player's size. These sawblades are connected to the player with a chain
each. They deal X melee damage to any enemies that touch them. Hitting the sawblades with a sword causes them to fly in the cursor's direction and return on enemy/tile
hit (boomerang).*/
