Tips

    It is highly advised to have a plan for dealing with each item ahead of time instead of trying to access stun methods on the go.
    Using any gun with 22 Hornet Rounds against an item (aside from Divine Retribution and Rover Drive) will stagger them for a 2 seconds with a 20 second cooldown.

Trivia

    The 22 Bullet Theory's theme is THE SHOT HEARD 'ROUND THE WORLD, which was composed by Sploopo. The theme uses motifs from the original theme, Stinging Onslaught, which was composed by Turquoise.
    Each item, its behavior, and its defeat method are all references to the "Gods" killed during the original 22 Bullet Theory.
        The order in which the items appear is the same order that each represented god was killed by the bullet chronologically.
