	gemini glaive m2
	pugnent eyeball minion from lump of flesh
	mini true eye deathray
	true mutant armour ring ray

HUGE internal refactor, friendly homing projectiles are marked as homing in code
MASSIVE internal refactor so that many projectiles aren't destroyed on contact with things like plantera crystals, golem/earth champ hands, etc.
	this is mainly for yoyos, held projs, etc.
	these projectile-destroying things can destroy most minion shots (but not minions themselves)
only small rainbow slimes' spikes ignore tiles
buffed jungle ench dash speed very slightly
buffed chloro ench dash speed a lot
abom/mutant focus a single target until that target flees/dies in mp
lava slimes only lava jump with line of sight, so it'll spam much less lava now
webs in spider caves also inflict 3sec slow
internal refactor for additional attacks (pumpkings cape, celestial rune)
	they now have minion attacks and minions can proc it!
	can now also proc with yoyos and other held projs
	nerfed pumpkings cape support damage
wof is immune to chilled to fix that crash
tweaked devious aestheticus projectile visuals
fixed mutant not dropping phantasmal energy when intended

removed biome mimic old coin attack
	hallow mimic uses daedalus stormbow
	corrupt mimic uses clinger staff
	crimson mimic vomits ichor

unspeakably GARGANTUAN internal refactor for many projectiles that associate with other entities e.g. homing, or sticks to them
	lowkey do a full pt and see if anything bugs or went missing
nerfed eow contact cursed inferno duration to 6sec (was 10)

adjusted jungle ench spore attack
	base damage nerfed to 12 (was 30)
	now scales up to 48 with jungle+wizard or chloro ench
	scales up to 108 with chloro+wizard or force (was 150)
	uses separate iframes, no longer disrupts your attacks
	spore cloud production rate slightly nerfed
	finally fixed chloro ench tooltip
penetrator dash mp sync adjusted(?), will remove your hook on use

resprites
	22 painting
	sparkling love
	sigil of champions

sparkling love and styx gazer have glowmasks when devi/abom is using them
made devi big sparkling love hitbox a lot more accurate to the sprite
tweaked devi movement to not oscilate weirdly durign attacks like heart rain

tried improving mp sync
	jungle jump
	jungle dash
	shinobi dash
	monk dash
plantera p2 transition deletes leftover flying rings
tweaked dev aes proj movement
suffocation now scales the longer the npc is being suffocated so it doesn't melt early enemies so fast
tweak to how projs are deleted sometimes
RE-RE-REFACTORED projectile deletion mechanics
ebon/shade ench only work with line of sight (unless force)
fixed flower boots crashing the game

fixed ccrystal leaves not using projec dleeotin emchabsic checks
added wof vanilla laser telegraph
fix ebon/shade crashes
TITANIC internal refactor for homing, see if anything broke

sandnado and friendly vanilla deathrays (last prism, charged blaster cannon, etc) outrank most deletion things
updated chalice tooltip
internal refactor for wizard ench so it doesnt need to be checked independently of all forces
added abom rebirth debuff icon
bee ench damage is capped without terraria soul, effectively treats the source weapon as if its base damage is 300 (so it isnt OP with railgun)
