refactored to sync in mp better:
	sparkling love
	styx gazer m2
	penetrator deathray
	diffractor blaster
	gemini glaive m2
	pugnent eyeball minion from lump of flesh
	mini true eye deathray
	true mutant armour ring ray
	mini saucer minion
HUGE internal refactor, friendly homing projectiles are marked as homing in code
MASSIVE internal refactor so that many projectiles aren't destroyed on contact with things like plantera crystals, golem/earth champ hands, etc.
	this is mainly for yoyos, held projs, etc.
	these projectile-destroying things can destroy most minion shots (but not minions themselves)
only small rainbow slimes' spikes ignore tiles
buffed jungle ench dash speed very slightly
buffed chloro ench dash speed a lot
abom/mutant focus a single target until that target flees/dies in mp
lava slimes only lava jump with line of sight, so it'll spam much less lava now
webs in spider caves also inflict 3sec slow
internal refactor for additional attacks (pumpkings cape, celestial rune)
	they now have minion attacks and minions can proc it!
	can now also proc with yoyos and other held projs
	nerfed pumpkings cape support damage
wof is immune to chilled to fix that crash
tweaked devious aestheticus projectile visuals
fixed mutant not dropping phantasmal energy when intended

removed biome mimic old coin attack
	hallow mimic uses daedalus stormbow
	corrupt mimic uses clinger staff
	crimson mimic vomits ichor
	jungle mimic shoots plantera tentacles
unspeakably GARGANTUAN internal refactor for many projectiles that associate with other entities e.g. homing, or sticks to them
	lowkey do a full pt and see if anything bugs or went missing
nerfed eow contact cursed inferno duration to 6sec (was 10)
