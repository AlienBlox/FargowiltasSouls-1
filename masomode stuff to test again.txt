shortened abom cirno tell time
shortened delay between mutant attacks in p22 slightly
reduced intensity of abom scythe split tells
shortened mutant glaive tell time
mutant presence affects regen properly
buffed mutant glaive attack, more crystals and less glaive startup, nerfed overall size of crystal stars
mutant will try to avoid doing p2 attacks immediatley on goign into p22
fixed mutant despawn issues i think
abom swings gazer
abom dashes higher speed in emode p2
devi cleanses debuffs during bribery cutscene
devi briefly holds out paladin hammers before throwing them
mutant/abom get slightly closer before beginning fight so aura doesnt start so close to you
properly finally fixed mutant glaives/devi hammers not actually following their intended paths exactly
