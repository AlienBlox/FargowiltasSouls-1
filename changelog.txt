NEW UPDATE - V {ModVersion}

Ashwood/Obsidian Enchant now only counts a standard set list of debuffs; same list used for universal debuff immunities and Mothron random debuffs and such

Fixed Eternity vanilla boss behavior toggle being able to desync in multiplayer (Fixes DLC multiplayer boss desync issue)
No Cursed Coffin arena generation code runs if Remmnants is enabled (should fix crash)
Fixed Spirit Longbow arrow trail not being owned by owner
