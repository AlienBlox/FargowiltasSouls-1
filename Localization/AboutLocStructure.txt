The autogenerated entries are seperated in files of their names.
The Mods.FargowiltasSouls.hjson is unused now.
Some entries (Conditions, RecipeGroups, Toggler...) are grouped together because of their similar usages.
Some entries (was in ItemExtra or Message) are directly put in Mods.FargowiltasSouls.Items.{ItemName} or Mods.FargowiltasSouls.NPCs.{NPCName} because they are closely related.
Mods.FargowiltasSouls.Items.Extra contains "global" texts of items (EModeBalance tooltips are in EModeBalance), and Mods.FargowiltasSouls.NPCs.EMode contains EMode texts of NPCs.
Mods.FargowiltasSouls.Message contains messages which aren't closely related to a ModItem or a ModNPC.
Entries about Boss Checklist is in entries of each boss.

Note: 
·Some of the contents need the hjson of the dev version of Mutant Mod. (About GiveDevianttGifts ModCall)
·Boss Checklist no longer support despawn messages for MiniBosses, so champions' despawn messages can't be displayed in game now.
