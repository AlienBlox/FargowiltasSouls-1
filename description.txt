-DESTROYED MODDED ENCHANTS (for now)
-thorium effects all in their own file
-Ninja smoke bombs disappear shortly after teleporting
-Pearlwood and basically everything else wont work on target dummies
-Tin Crits now have a cooldown: 1 seconds between crit gains, half a second in Terra Force, quarter of a second in SoT, no limit in SoE
-Valhalla Knight Enchantment rework: Now grants a buff after continually attacking an enemy that makes you reduce iframes of all enemies for some time. Buff now lasts 5 seconds, effect was 2 seconds before. The cooldown is removed, was 15 seconds. iframes will no longer be reset if they were already low enough
-Squire Enchantment rework: Effect is now a weaker version of Valhalla Knight, less than half as good

-Angler Enchant lost Frost Daggerfish, gained Angler Tackle Bag and its effects 
-Wood bois

-Wood Enchantments no longer gain bonuses in certain biomes, they always have the old buffed effect or a slightly weaker version of it

-Rich Mahogany hooks will no longer shoot at enemies in the jungle
-Wood now makes critters self destruct shortly after releasing them, no more souls, takes any bird in recipe (special effects for certain critters coming soon)
-Copper lightning is smaller visually, there's no more bonus if the enemy is wet, the chance for the lightning is 4x higher, with Terra Force the effect can hit 10x as many targets, deals 5x damage and has a cooldown less than half
-Ninja Enchant will now teleport you correctly onto platforms making it much better to use probably. First Strike no longer multiplies projectiles and the next attack will deal 3x damage, same as melee
-Monk Enchant dash now charges when not attacking, instead of standing still. Charge time doubled
-Rain Enchant - Halved the amount of damage you have to deal to spawn a rain cloud, rain drops have full damage of the projectile that spawned it, lightning has 2x damage. Any projectiles will affect the cloud, not just 'wet projectiles'. Lightning spawns at the edge of the cloud instead of the center. The cloud will not rise higher than intended now
-Gold Enchant now has a cooldown debuff
-Stardust Enchant now has a cooldown debuff. When it runs out, a dust ring appears around your stardust guardian
-Huntress Enchant can now rain whatever arrow type is in your first slot like Red Riding could, arrow rain lasts much longer, fall faster, and covers a slighlty wider area, decreased cooldown to 10 seconds
-Red Riding Enchant's arrows now follow the cursor, fires the double the arrows of Huntress, has a half the CD of Huntress (you can almost always have arrow rain active)
-Molten Enchant aura damage scales with highest damage type instead of just melee damage. Old aura damage: 20 damage up to 80 damage when enemies are very close to you proccing once per second. New: always 20 damage, but the speed of the damage dealt will be increased as enemies get closer up to 10 procs per second (200 damage)
-Obsidian Enchant rework: You have normal gravity and movement in lava, you can swim in lava. While in lava attacks spawn iframe ignoring explosions on hit
-Shadewood rework: Now gives you an aura similar to ebonwood. While in the aura, enemies will spill out blood when attacked
-Shroomite Enchant rework: While in stealth all attacks gain a trail of mushrooms. Swords and projectiles
-Spooky Enchant rework: Now makes all minions directly attack with scythes instead of throwing them out randomly. The scythe no longer has infinite pierce and will die shortly after hitting the first enemy, it has special immune frames, Scythes no longer split into smaller scythes, scythes are much smaller
-Gladiator Enchantment spears fall twice as fast and deal half as much damage
-Frost Enchantment rework: The icicles move twice as fast when launched. Damage now scales. Icicles rotate slower. Max icicles increased from 3 to 30. Icicles are launched when you attack no matter how many there are, if you keep attacking you will just keep firing one at a time. The longer you don't attack the faster they spawn. If 10 or more connect with an enemy, the enemy, bosses included, is frozen for one second and they take 20% increased damage from you for 5 seconds. The more icicles that hit, the longer the freeze
-Vortex Enchantment rework: Vortex damage now scales. The vortex lasts much longer. The Vortex now additionally pulls in all projectiles. The suck range is much larger. While stealthed your projectiles will not be sucked in. When the vortex runs out any non boss nearby is wiped from existence. The cooldown to spawn a void is much longer.
-Orichalcum Enchantment rework: No longer spawns fireballs. Petals inflict On Fire, Cursed Inferno, Shadowflame, or Frostburn on hit. All DoTs deal 5x damage. Petals reset iframes.
