-Fish Stick's tornado height scales with minion slots up to 5
-Fish Stick sharks now pierce 
-Valhalla Knight Enchantment rework: Now grants a buff after continually attacking an enemy that makes you reduce iframes of all enemies for some time. Buff now lasts 5 seconds, effect was 2 seconds before. The cooldown is removed, was 15 seconds. iframes will no longer be reset if they were already low enough
-Squire Enchantment rework: Effect is now a weaker version of Valhalla Knight, less than half as good











All enchant and soul recipes changed drastically

Enchants
-Removed dev items from Soa enchants
-DESTROYED MODDED ENCHANTS (for now)
-thorium effects all in their own file
-Ninja smoke bombs disappear shortly after teleporting
-Pearlwood and basically everything else wont work on target dummies

-Angler Enchant lost Frost Daggerfish, gained Angler Tackle Bag and its effects

-Wood now makes critters self destruct shortly after releasing them, no more souls, takes any bird in recipe (special effects for certain critters coming soon)
-Copper lightning is smaller visually, there's no more bonus if the enemy is wet, the chance for the lightning is 4x higher, with Terra Force the effect can hit 10x as many targets, deals 5x damage and has a cooldown less than half
-Ninja Enchant will now teleport you correctly onto platforms making it much better to use probably. First Strike no longer multiplies projectiles and the next attack will deal 3x damage, same as melee
-Monk Enchant dash now charges when not attacking, instead of standing still. Charge time doubled
-Rain Enchant - Halved the amount of damage you have to deal to spawn a rain cloud, rain drops have full damage of the projectile that spawned it, lightning has 2x damage.

-Stardust Enchant now has a cooldown debuff. When it runs out, a dust ring appears around your stardust guardian

-Red Riding Enchant's arrows now follow the cursor, fires the double the arrows of Huntress, has a half the CD of Huntress (you can almost always have arrow rain active)
-Molten Enchant aura damage scales with highest damage type instead of just melee damage. Old aura damage: 20 damage up to 80 damage when enemies are very close to you proccing once per second. New: always 20 damage, but the speed of the damage dealt will be increased as enemies get closer up to 10 procs per second (200 damage)
-Obsidian Enchant rework: You have normal gravity and movement in lava, you can swim in lava. While in lava attacks spawn iframe ignoring explosions on hit
-Shadewood rework: Now gives you an aura similar to ebonwood. While in the aura, enemies will spill out blood when attacked
