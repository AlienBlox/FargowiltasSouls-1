Eskimo zombie replace but actually good
Frost crashes on WoF
Add tooltips to weapons that have mechanics
Eternity weapon nerf tooltips
Look at small sting damage crit fixed e
reduced piranha plant voodoo doll stack to 1 and always stay on when you exit and rejoin the world

Make the Orichalcum Enchant incentivize augmenting more debuff-inflicting gear in your loadout by making the petal inflict a unique “orichalcum poison” debuff instead of a random fire debuff. I would love to use stuff like cursed ammo or book and frost armor in fights, but Orichalcum already inflicting these makes them not useful. This change would be both a nerf (less damage without additional debuffs) and a buff (if you do have all the debuffs, you get Ori Poison with it).


-Turtle Enchant shell no longer has a certain number of hits, just a certain a amount of time before it breaks, shell grows back quicker, DR increased to 99% while in shell
-Huntress and Red Reding Enchants constant arrow rain will account for the targets speed and dont just fall straight down

-Apprentice Enchant killing enemies or damaging bosses spawns flamebursts that fly to you and orbit you for awhile, hitting enemeies with them spawns a shadow clone that mimics your attacks
